# Preface: 
One of the holy grails for the radiology community is finding prognostic biomarkers for cancer progression. More specifically, a major push has been to find blood-based biomarkers that allow us to properly characterize the tumor burden of a patient. However, this biomarker discovery pipeline remained a huge challenge — only a small perentage of proposed blood-based markers ever make it to clinical viability after rigorous experimental verification and validation studies. Because of this, we propose an in silico approach to screening the viability of protein biomarkers using proteomic features and matheamtical models of shedding kinetics in early-stage solid tumors.

# Mathematical modeling of tumor biomarker shedding
By introducing spatial dimensionality to traditional 1D compartment models, our team encodes intratumoral heterogeneity as a gradient of tissue oxygenation dependent on distance to proximal vasculature. Given a patient’s plasma marker concentration, we can not only predict tumor staging and extracellular shedding from proliferating cells, but also capture emergent hypoxic regions (associated with metastatic activity) and intracellular shedding via necrosis.
