### Preface: Mathematical modeling of tumor biomarker shedding
Can we do better with tumor characterization via blood-based biomarker detection? Aligning with the Canary Center’s push for this idea, we seek to further mathematical models of biomarker shedding kinetics in early-stage solid tumors. 

By introducing spatial dimensionality to traditional 1D compartment models, our team encodes intratumoral heterogeneity as a gradient of tissue oxygenation dependent on distance to proximal vasculature. Given a patient’s plasma marker concentration, we can not only predict tumor staging and extracellular shedding from proliferating cells, but also capture emergent hypoxic regions (associated with metastatic activity) and intracellular shedding via necrosis. In order to generalize model inputs over all protein biomarkers, we define parameters as probabilistic heuristics trained on a dataset of 3000+ proteins. We aim to publish this modeling regime next month in Nature Scientific Reports followed by a validation study involving in vivo mouse xenografts.
